Steps:

1. Gather the data

Most geodemographic segmentation systems use the census and can be dowloaded for free, such as the Canadian census (https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page_Download-Telecharger.cfm?Lang=E&Tab=1&Geo1=PR&Code1=01&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&SearchText=01&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=3&type=0)
Make sure to download the data at the geographic level you want to work at, smaller is generally better

Any other data should be downloaded as well, this could be location data, crime data, or any other data that is available to you
the sample system here uses crime data downloaded from Toronto Police Service and location data from the City of Toronto's open data portal

2. Initial Data Processing

Data from different censuses can arrive in different formats, but the data should be formatted so it has the first column as your geography ID/code with the remaining columns as the variables
Most of this processing could be done in excel, but SPSS or google sheets could be used as well

Any data that is at a point level would need to be aggregated into the same geography level as the other data and formatted the same as above

3. Variable Selection

Selecting variables is a key element for creating the direction of the system
This system uses variables for crime and demographic variables either standard for geodemographic systems or that have been found to be indicitive of crime levels

Some common variables for geodemographic systems are age, income, race, occupation, family type, and housing type

To see the variables used in the sample system please see VariableList.xlsx

Ensure that the data only includes the variables that have been selected for clustering

4. Secondary Data Processing

To emphasize characteristics, weights can be assigned to each variable to emphasize clustering on specific variables, these weights are included in VariableList.xlsx
Multiply the data by these weights before clustering

5. Clustering

Using the script
