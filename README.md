# Open-Geodemographic-Segmentation-System-in-Python
Create a geodemographic segmentation system using python and k-means

In Canada there are no open geodemographic segmentation systems that are free for use by the public. Comparable systems exist in the UK and USA, but no such system exists for Canada. This is an attempt to create a system that is free for anyone to use and provide all of the scripts so that anyone can create their own process, for Canada or elsewhere.

The resulting system, documentation, and scripts are in this repository for anyone to use
